# DA LATA — Architecture v0.3

## Target
- Godot 4.7.2 stable.
- GDScript.
- Mobile-first portrait UI, with Web/Desktop compatibility.
- Data-driven content as the project expands.

## Current slice
GameState is an Autoload that owns canonical simulation state and emits UI-facing signals.

UI (Main scene)
  -> GameState Autoload
     -> CultivationService: cycle, care and harvest transitions
     -> EconomyService: buyer pricing and sale deltas
     -> BusinessService: room operating-cost aggregation
     -> SaveService: schema dispatch, migration and JSON-safe snapshots
     -> Heat / Reputation / Influence / random events

Cultivation, economy and business calculations live behind domain services. GameState remains the orchestration boundary and owns canonical runtime state.

## Room model
V0.3 now has explicit room-scoped cultivation state.

Each room stores primitive, save-safe state:

- instance_id: unique runtime/save identity, for example room_1.
- definition_id: stable room content identity, for example quarto_inicial.
- cultivation.active_cultivar_id: stable cultivar content identity.
- cultivation.grow_day.
- cultivation.grow_health.
- cultivation.cared_today.
- cultivation.inventory.
- cultivation.batch_quality.

active_room_id selects which room the existing UI surface renders and commands. GameState keeps a UI-facing compatibility cache for the active room, but rooms[].cultivation is canonical. Switching rooms only changes that projection; it does not copy cultivation state between rooms.

The default state still contains one quarto_inicial room with R$ 15/day operating cost, preserving V0.2 behavior. New rooms begin with the default abstract cultivation state. next_day advances every room independently in stable array order using the shared deterministic RNG stream.

## Save schema v3
Schema v3 moves cultivation from the old global state into each room rather than mutating schema v2 in place.

schema_version: 3
state:
  day / cash / heat / reputation / influence / game_over
business:
  active_room_id
  rooms[]:
    instance_id
    definition_id
    cultivation:
      active_cultivar_id
      grow_day / grow_health / cared_today
      inventory / batch_quality
simulation:
  seed
  rng_state

Rules:
1. Content is referenced by stable IDs, never serialized Resource objects.
2. rng_state remains a decimal string so JSON cannot lose 64-bit precision.
3. V3 restores the exact RNG position and every room cultivation snapshot.
4. V1 migrates its single legacy cultivation snapshot into room_1.
5. V2 retains its room list, migrates the legacy global cultivation snapshot into the saved active room and initializes other rooms with default cultivation state.
6. Unknown schema versions, room definitions and cultivars are rejected.
7. Filesystem/cloud save slots remain outside the domain snapshot contract.

## State rules
1. Domain state never depends on UI nodes.
2. UI sends commands and renders emitted state.
3. Randomness lives in simulation services, not presentation code.
4. Persistent state changes enter through an explicit versioned save boundary.
5. Content IDs are stable StringName values in Resources and plain strings in serialized state.
6. Room switching changes the active projection, never another room's canonical cultivation state.

## Next architecture milestone
With room-scoped cultivation stable, continue V0.3 with Staff/Upgrades. Contract Board and Compliance remain subsequent business-layer waves.

# SIGA HANDOFF — DA LATA

## Verified repository
- Repository: `az1nn/growing-rio`
- Default branch: `master`
- Repository-local SIGA: `.agents/skills/siga/SKILL.md`
- Concurrency helper: `.agents/skills/siga-concurrency/SKILL.md`
- Ratified constitution: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- Live repository / CI always overrides this handoff.

## Current route
**WATCH -> ADVANCE after exact-head validation of this handoff closure**

Feature 007 is implemented, merged and product-validated. The mutating Web export then produced the generated default-branch commit `1d129e1973cb7f54cf1cdc79220e8849122c1459`. This handoff closure is intentionally based on that live generated HEAD so it cannot overwrite export output.

After this handoff reaches `master` and that exact final HEAD passes `Validate project`, recompute live state and classify **ADVANCE** unless a newer engineering priority supersedes the roadmap.

## Completed — feature 007
- Spec: `specs/007-act-v-final-form-eligibility/`.
- Feature branch: `feat/007-act-v-final-form-eligibility`.
- PR #46: **MERGED** — `feat(007): add Act V final-form eligibility`.
- Final PR head: `f1822d06173d2b64adcfe96d1bc248dc37d7adb4`.
- Exact-head PR validation: `Validate project` run #229 / `35927637412` — **SUCCESS**.
- Vercel status on final PR head: **SUCCESS**.
- PR #46 was merged with `expected_head_sha=f1822d06173d2b64adcfe96d1bc248dc37d7adb4`.
- Guarded merge result: `fb581466c01b9a5c7411770205127afe341b1cb1` — **SUCCESS**.
- Post-merge default-branch validation: `Validate project` run #230 / `35927715038` on `fb581466c01b9a5c7411770205127afe341b1cb1` — **SUCCESS**.
- Post-merge Web export: `Export Godot web build` run #17 / `35927715241` — **SUCCESS**.
- Generated Web refresh commit: `1d129e1973cb7f54cf1cdc79220e8849122c1459`.
- Vercel status on generated Web refresh HEAD: **SUCCESS**.
- Feature-007 tasks T001–T014 are complete with this persisted closure.
- The V0.5 finale roadmap item remains open because ending selection, finale handoff and ending codas are not implemented yet.

## Product result
- `event_forma_da_lata` now unlocks naturally after `lore_da_lata_name_canonical`.
- The event records one of four canonical intervention postures while always setting `lore_final_form_debate_seen`.
- No final-form choice stores an ending ID or completes `arc_da_lata`.
- `EndingEligibilityService` derives zero, one or multiple eligible ending-family IDs from accumulated campaign state without RNG, scoring or ranking.
- `GameState.eligible_ending_ids()` exposes that derived domain boundary without adding UI state.
- The six documented families remain available as neutral possibilities:
  - Marca Nacional;
  - Rede Viva;
  - Noite Sem Rótulo;
  - Arquivo Público;
  - Atlântico;
  - O Verão Volta.
- `O Verão Volta` remains a composite family, not a “true ending”, and requires mixed system maturity plus participation in both market relationships.
- Save schema remains v10 because eligibility is recomputed from canonical persisted state.
- Existing Ato V opening now hands off to the final-form debate after save/restore as well.

## Validation added
- Added `tests/act_v_final_form_eligibility_test.gd`.
- Added the regression to `.github/workflows/validate.yml`.
- Extended `tools/validate_project.py` with final-form Resource and eligibility-service contracts.
- Updated `tests/act_v_reconstruction_opening_test.gd` to expect the feature-007 handoff.
- Updated `tests/campaign_state_test.gd` from 12 to 13 canonical narrative events.
- Exact-head CI proved the new regression, existing campaign/research/presentation suites and save-v10 migrations green together.

## Concurrency reconciliation
- Feature 007 started from validated `master@b615eb367fdd12d8341644fee9b37b5df99b1afb`.
- No open PRs overlapped the feature at the implementation write barriers.
- Immediately before guarded merge, PR #46 was the only open PR; its base remained `b615eb367fdd12d8341644fee9b37b5df99b1afb`, its validated head remained `f1822d06173d2b64adcfe96d1bc248dc37d7adb4`, and GitHub reported it mergeable.
- The Web export workflow is mutative and advanced `master` from the product merge to `1d129e1973cb7f54cf1cdc79220e8849122c1459`.
- This handoff branch starts from that generated commit and therefore incorporates, rather than overwrites, the generated Web artifact.
- At the post-export reconciliation there were no open PRs.

## Final gate note
- GitHub Actions bot pushes do not independently trigger the normal `push` validation workflow for the generated Web commit.
- The product merge commit itself is fully validated; the generated commit has successful export and Vercel evidence.
- The handoff closure creates the next user-authored HEAD. Its own PR exact-head validation and the merged `master` validation are the final closure gates.
- Never reuse run evidence after the handoff head changes; read CI against the actual SHA.

## Next engineering action
After the exact final `master` HEAD carrying this handoff is green:
1. Reconcile live `master`, open PRs, Actions and Vercel.
2. If no newer priority supersedes this state, classify **ADVANCE**.
3. Keep the V0.5 finale roadmap item open.
4. Define the next smallest Spec Kit feature around **selecting and persisting one ending family from the already-derived eligible set**.
5. Explicitly decide in that spec whether selection requires a save-schema bump; do not add persistence accidentally.
6. Keep `event_da_lata_handoff`, ending-specific codas and `arc_da_lata` completion out of that wave unless the new spec demonstrates they are inseparable from the smallest coherent capability.
7. Preserve ending neutrality: eligibility and selection must never imply a moral ranking or a “correct” ending.
8. Preserve reconstruction-as-reconstruction, unresolved provenance/order/lineage, fictional/systemic institutional content and abstract non-operational parallel-market references.
9. Route the capability through spec -> plan -> tasks -> implementation -> exact-head validation.

## Boundaries
- Cultivation remains abstract and non-operational.
- Parallel-market activity remains abstract risk/reward with no real-world logistics or evasion guidance.
- Institutional/political gameplay remains fictional and systemic; no real politicians, parties, elections or targeted persuasion.
- No faction, institutional form or ending is treated as morally correct.
- Real-history inspiration remains distinct from fictional canon.
- Chat/model memory is not canonical project state.

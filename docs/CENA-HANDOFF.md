## Route
**CENA-ADVANCE**

The first player-visible 3D presentation slice is implemented, merged and exported. Vercel rate limiting remains an unresolved deployment gate, but it is now classified as `SOFT_GATE_RATE_LIMIT`: merge/deployment validation debt, not a development lock. CENA may advance with bounded visual work and stack PRs while preserving the unresolved provider gate.

## Visual target delivered to repository
Operation / grow-space diorama behind the existing management UI, with no gameplay or save-schema changes.

## Implemented
- `scenes/visual/operation_diorama.tscn`
  - Node3D scene root;
  - orthographic `Camera3D` with portrait-oriented `KEEP_WIDTH`;
  - `WorldEnvironment` using a dark cool background + color ambient light;
  - one cool `DirectionalLight3D`;
  - one warm non-shadowed `OmniLight3D`;
  - primitive room shell, counter, shelves, storage and abstract plant-volume blockout;
  - restrained concrete / tile / metal / wood / terracotta / green palette.
- `scenes/main/main.tscn`
  - instances the 3D diorama;
  - preserves existing `Control` gameplay UI;
  - adds a non-interactive translucent `AtmosphereVeil` between 3D and UI.
- `tools/validate_project.py`
  - requires the visual scene and CENA docs;
  - asserts Camera3D, WorldEnvironment, lights, orthographic portrait camera contract and main-scene integration.
- `docs/VISUAL-DIRECTION.md`
  - records research evidence and the resulting visual grammar.
- `web/**`
  - regenerated from the merged Godot scene by the successful Web export workflow.

## Research performed
### Godot / platform
- https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.7/classes/class_camera3d.html
- https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/rendering/renderers.html
- https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/performance/optimizing_3d_performance.html
- https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.7/engine_details/architecture/internal_rendering_architecture.html

Decision:
- keep Compatibility/Web;
- orthographic portrait camera;
- primitive geometry;
- reused materials;
- two lights, neither shadow-casting.

### Current product head
- `947381910d815648293cd855d39e13c97c8793aa`
- Commit message: `chore(web): refresh exported build`
- Produced by the successful run #22.
- Vercel status: **failure — build rate limit**
- No GitHub Actions run was instantiated on this bot-authored commit.
- Therefore repository/export evidence is green, but public deployment parity is **not yet proven**.

## Boundaries preserved
- existing management mechanics unchanged;
- no save-schema change;
- no new narrative canon;
- cultivation remains abstract/non-operational;
- no real-world market-evasion/logistics detail;
- no political persuasion content introduced.

## Known visual debt
- current environment geometry and most materials remain BLOCKOUT quality;
- visual acceptance still needs real screenshot/device inspection;
- no external production prop/texture set has been introduced;
- public Vercel delivery of this exact wave remains blocked by platform build-rate limiting.

## Next action
On the next standalone `CENA`:
1. reconcile current `master`, this handoff and Vercel status;
2. treat explicit Vercel build-rate limiting as `SOFT_GATE_RATE_LIMIT`: keep affected merge/deploy validation pending but continue safe visual development;
3. stack dependent visual PRs explicitly when their base is not yet merged;
4. when provider capacity returns, validate/merge the oldest unresolved dependency first and reconcile the stack;
5. next visual production slice: replace the highest-impact blockout surfaces/props with a small production-candidate asset/material pass while preserving the proven camera/lighting grammar unless visual inspection rejects it;
5. if deployment requires infrastructure/configuration work rather than simple gate recovery, route that dependency through SIGA.

## Canonical-state rule
`REAL REPOSITORY STATE > CENA HANDOFF > VISUAL DIRECTION > CHAT/MEMORY`


## Rate-limit stacking policy update
- Explicit provider build/deploy rate limits are soft external gates.
- They defer merge/public-deploy proof for the affected PR but do not lock CENA development.
- Dependent work may be stacked with explicit PR bases and inherited pending provider validation.
- Real build/import/test/export/configuration failures remain hard gates.


## Stacked visual wave 002
- Stack base PR: **#55**
- Base branch: `chore/rate-limit-stacking-policy`
- Base head at claim: `3db5dbd92aa748f56fb74f220ce448c35f14ca88`
- Working branch: `feat/cena-002-material-props-pass`
- Inherited external state: `SOFT_GATE_RATE_LIMIT` (Vercel)
- Rate-limit effect: merge/provider-validation debt only; development continues.

### Scope
- externalize seven reusable material resources;
- promote planter/canopy silhouettes from cube blockout to low-segment primitives;
- add restrained window trim and service-pipe dressing;
- preserve camera, UI overlay, gameplay semantics and Compatibility/Web constraints.

### Provenance
All wave-002 runtime assets are original Godot resources/primitives. No third-party runtime asset is introduced.

### Gate
Exact-head repository/Godot validation is required for this stacked head. Provider rate limiting remains pending external validation and is not a stop-work lock.


## Stack reconciliation
- PR #55 was validated and merged bottom-up into `master` at `647687a8f10db15691ae8acefc4b08e47f8a26dc`.
- PR #56 was retargeted from `chore/rate-limit-stacking-policy` to `master`.
- Wave-002 Web export run #29 succeeded and generated branch artifact commit `926f0fd172bd3713ccad970ced852b2649091942`.
- Vercel remains `SOFT_GATE_RATE_LIMIT`; this does not invalidate the visual implementation/export, but it defers provider-validation/merge where required.
- Current reason for `CENA-WATCH`: exact-head repository validation must run on the retargeted PR head. This is an internal hard gate, not the Vercel rate limit.


## Wave-002 exact-head validation
- Validated head: `340642038840c2fe92c7d6870519cd7024c19d8c`
- Validate project run #253: **success**
  - structural validator: success
  - Godot headless import: success
  - full regression suite: success
- Vercel: `SOFT_GATE_RATE_LIMIT`
- Route implication: external throttling is merge/provider-validation debt only; CENA may continue with further bounded work.


## Stacked visual wave 003
- Parent visual PR: **#56**
- Stack base branch: `feat/cena-002-material-props-pass`
- Stack base head: `dd8a9e58b60a926a5b3805f944f9fcfcc816f251`
- Working branch: `feat/cena-003-fixture-detail-pass`
- Inherited external state: `SOFT_GATE_RATE_LIMIT` (Vercel on parent visual delivery)
- Development route: **CENA-ADVANCE** — provider throttling does not lock this bounded dependent visual slice.

### Visual target
Promote the highest-impact remaining operation fixtures without changing gameplay or introducing an external asset pack:
- counter/cabinet front rhythm and handles;
- steel shelf cross-bracing;
- compact shelf storage-bin silhouettes.

### Research
Reference-only architecture review:
- Apartamento Cosme Velho / Venta Arquitetos — concrete work surface, integrated storage and exposed metallic conduit:
  https://www.archdaily.com.br/pt/1042780/apartamento-cosme-velho-venta-arquitetos
- Flamengo Apartment / Nop Arquitetura — demountable metalwork shelving:
  https://www.archdaily.com/957602/flamengo-apartment-nop-arquitetura
- FM Apartment / Zanatta Figueiredo — exposed concrete with custom steel shelving:
  https://www.archdaily.com/1064144/fm-apartment-zanatta-figueiredo

Implementation decision: keep the visual language structural and lightweight, using only existing repository materials plus original Godot BoxMesh detail geometry. No source image or third-party runtime asset is imported.

### Runtime changes
- `scenes/visual/operation_diorama.tscn`
  - adds three warm-wood counter fronts and dark-metal handles;
  - adds crossed dark-metal shelf braces;
  - adds three compact storage-bin volumes using the existing teal/metal/terracotta palette;
  - preserves camera, environment, two-light strategy, UI overlay and Compatibility/Web renderer assumptions.

### Provenance
- new fixture/detail geometry: `ORIGINAL / PRODUCTION-CANDIDATE`
- third-party runtime assets: **none**
- license-unknown assets: **none**
- attribution requirements: **none**

### Concurrency
This wave is intentionally stacked on PR #56 because it edits the same operation-diorama scene and depends on wave-002 reusable materials. It must not be retargeted to `master` until #56 is merged/reconciled bottom-up.

### Validation gate
- repository/Godot exact-head validation: **pending on the final PR head**
- external Vercel provider validation: inherited `SOFT_GATE_RATE_LIMIT`; merge/deploy proof debt only
- real Godot import/export/test failure remains a hard gate and must not be reclassified as rate limiting.

### Remaining visual debt
- solid storage crates remain BLOCKOUT;
- structural room shell remains BLOCKOUT;
- screenshot/device visual acceptance remains outstanding;
- public deployment parity remains unproven while the provider rate limit persists.

### Next visual action
After exact-head validation of wave 003, the next CENA run should reconcile the stack first. If repository/engine gates are green and only the provider throttle remains, continue with the next smallest player-visible slice rather than waiting: likely storage-crate/room-shell silhouette promotion or screenshot-driven composition corrections, whichever live evidence ranks higher.


## CENA resume — 2026-09-23

### Reconciled live state
- canonical repository: `az1nn/growing-rio`;
- `master`: `647687a8f10db15691ae8acefc4b08e47f8a26dc`;
- parent visual PR: **#56** — open, mergeable, base `master`;
- current visual PR: **#57** — open, mergeable, stacked on #56;
- pre-resume PR #57 head: `d3b1c8a9cc3e8b28044f01b68fee83ebcd2a1f3c`;
- Vercel: `SOFT_GATE_RATE_LIMIT`;
- GitHub exact-head validation on the pre-resume #57 head: no workflow run observed.

### Route
**CENA-RESUME**

Wave 003 is implemented but not yet complete because repository/Godot exact-head validation evidence is missing. The provider rate limit remains soft and does not lock development; however, the missing internal engine/repository gate is not reclassified as rate limiting.

### Resume action
- inspected the PR #57 scene diff against the repository-local visual direction;
- confirmed the changes stay inside the bounded visual slice and reuse the established material/camera/light grammar;
- no additional runtime geometry is added in this resume step;
- this repository-local handoff persistence intentionally creates a new branch commit so branch/PR automation can instantiate exact-head validation;
- do not claim wave-003 completion until structural validation, Godot headless import and regression evidence are green on the resulting head.

### Next decision
- exact-head internal gates green + only provider throttle remains -> `CENA-ADVANCE`;
- internal validation running with no safe evidence-driven mutation needed -> `CENA-WATCH`;
- real scene/import/test/export failure -> `CENA-RESUME` on the failing wave;
- unresolved art/canon/license dependency -> `CENA-BLOCKED`.


### Post-persist verification
- persistence commit: `ac1ce3b9a511fb165ace039df9b986330f4919cd`;
- PR #57 remains open and mergeable;
- GitHub Actions workflow runs on this exact head: **0**;
- Vercel remains explicit `build-rate-limit` / `SOFT_GATE_RATE_LIMIT`.

### Routed technical dependency
The missing GitHub Actions instantiation on the new PR head is an engineering/delivery concern rather than visual production work. Route investigation through **SIGA** before calling wave 003 internally validated. CENA remains `CENA-RESUME`; no wave 004 should be claimed complete on top of an unvalidated engine/repository head.

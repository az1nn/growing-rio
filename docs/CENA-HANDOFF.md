## Route
**CENA-WATCH**

The first player-visible 3D presentation slice is implemented, merged and exported. The remaining gate is external delivery: Vercel currently reports a build-rate-limit failure for the current product head, so CENA must not claim the public deployment matches this visual wave yet.

## Visual target delivered to repository
Operation / grow-space diorama behind the existing management UI, with no gameplay or save-schema changes.

## Implemented
- `scenes/visual/operation_diorama.tscn`
  - Node3D scene root;
  - orthographic `Camera3D` with portrait-oriented `KEEP_WIDTH`;
  - `WorldEnvironment` using a dark cool background + color ambient light;
  - one cool `DirectionalLight3D`;
  - one warm non-shadowed `OmniLight3D`;
  - primitive room shell, counter, shelves, storage and abstract plant-volume blockout;
  - restrained concrete / tile / metal / wood / terracotta / green palette.
- `scenes/main/main.tscn`
  - instances the 3D diorama;
  - preserves existing `Control` gameplay UI;
  - adds a non-interactive translucent `AtmosphereVeil` between 3D and UI.
- `tools/validate_project.py`
  - requires the visual scene and CENA docs;
  - asserts Camera3D, WorldEnvironment, lights, orthographic portrait camera contract and main-scene integration.
- `docs/VISUAL-DIRECTION.md`
  - records research evidence and the resulting visual grammar.
- `web/**`
  - regenerated from the merged Godot scene by the successful Web export workflow.

## Research performed
### Godot / platform
- https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.7/classes/class_camera3d.html
- https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/rendering/renderers.html
- https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/performance/optimizing_3d_performance.html
- https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.7/engine_details/architecture/internal_rendering_architecture.html

Decision:
- keep Compatibility/Web;
- orthographic portrait camera;
- primitive geometry;
- reused materials;
- two lights, neither shadow-casting.

### Current product head
- `947381910d815648293cd855d39e13c97c8793aa`
- Commit message: `chore(web): refresh exported build`
- Produced by the successful run #22.
- Vercel status: **failure — build rate limit**
- No GitHub Actions run was instantiated on this bot-authored commit.
- Therefore repository/export evidence is green, but public deployment parity is **not yet proven**.

## Boundaries preserved
- existing management mechanics unchanged;
- no save-schema change;
- no new narrative canon;
- cultivation remains abstract/non-operational;
- no real-world market-evasion/logistics detail;
- no political persuasion content introduced.

## Known visual debt
- current environment geometry and most materials remain BLOCKOUT quality;
- visual acceptance still needs real screenshot/device inspection;
- no external production prop/texture set has been introduced;
- public Vercel delivery of this exact wave remains blocked by platform build-rate limiting.

## Next action
On the next standalone `CENA`:
1. reconcile current `master`, this handoff and Vercel status;
2. while Vercel remains rate-limited: stay `CENA-WATCH` and do not claim deployment;
3. when exact deployed-head evidence becomes green: switch to `CENA-ADVANCE`;
4. next visual production slice: replace the highest-impact blockout surfaces/props with a small production-candidate asset/material pass while preserving the proven camera/lighting grammar unless visual inspection rejects it;
5. if deployment requires infrastructure/configuration work rather than simple gate recovery, route that dependency through SIGA.

## Canonical-state rule
`REAL REPOSITORY STATE > CENA HANDOFF > VISUAL DIRECTION > CHAT/MEMORY`

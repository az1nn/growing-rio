# Implementation Plan: Campaign Progression Revalidation

**Feature:** rb-14-campaign-progression-revalidation  
**Spec:** [spec.md](./spec.md)  
**Planning state:** Future implementation — current RB MR is specs/docs only

## Technical Context

- Engine: Godot 4.7.2
- Language: GDScript
- Product source: `docs/SPEC-KIT-PRODUCT-REBASELINE.md`
- Canon/safety: constitution + `docs/lore/*`
- Validation: structural validator, relevant headless Godot regressions, scene/import smoke and exact-head CI as applicable

## Constitution Check

- Repository reality first: **REQUIRED**
- Spec-first: **PASS**
- UI/domain separation: **REQUIRED**
- Determinism/RNG stability: **REQUIRED**
- Persistence versioning/migrations when canonical shape changes: **REQUIRED**
- Canon/fiction/safety boundaries: **REQUIRED**
- Small coherent implementation wave: **REQUIRED**
- Exact-head evidence before implementation completion: **REQUIRED**

## Proposed Design

1. Build an act-by-act gate-to-player-action matrix.
2. Run deterministic scripted progression plus guided product playthrough where UX matters.
3. Compare uninterrupted vs save/restored paths.
4. Change only proven-misaligned gates.
5. Re-run specs 005-008 regressions.
6. Publish explicit finale-unfreeze decision.

## Expected Touchpoints

Exact paths MUST be reconciled from the live implementation branch. Candidate classes are `scenes/`, `autoload/game_state.gd` only when orchestration exposure is missing, `domain/` only for proven domain gaps, `resources/`, `tests/`, `tools/validate_project.py`, and architecture/roadmap/handoff docs.

## Persistence Impact

Do not assume a schema change from UI scope. Reuse current canonical state where sufficient. If implementation needs new canonical state, amend the spec first, version the save boundary, preserve supported migrations, and add round-trip/migration coverage.

## Validation Strategy

1. Reconcile live master, open PRs, relevant specs and handoffs.
2. Confirm dependencies and Product Experience Map assumptions.
3. Implement the smallest coherent slice.
4. Run structural validation and Godot import/smoke.
5. Run targeted and affected regression suites.
6. Validate portrait Web/mobile behavior for presentation changes.
7. Validate save/load equivalence when canonical state is touched.
8. Reconcile exact current PR head and overlaps.
9. Require repository-defined exact-head evidence before guarded merge.
10. Persist final verified state and next RB action.

## Current MR boundary

No runtime implementation belongs to the RB-specification MR.
